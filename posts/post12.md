## Assignment 3





I experimented with both strudel and Hydra.

Although I enjoy strudel, I prefer the process of making music to be more tactile and immediate than coding provides. However, this is not the case with visuals. I don't really have another avenue for quick visuals other than possibly using Max for a live patch with jitter. Max is great, but I personally don't really enjoy visual scripting languages. I'm too clumsy with the mouse to do it faster than I can type or patch a physical cable, so Hydra is almost perfect for what I desire."
