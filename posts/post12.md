## Assignment 3





I experimented with both strudel and Hydra.

Although I enjoy strudel and really enjoy the note sequencing, I prefer the process of making music to be more tactile and immediate than coding provides. However, this is not the case with visuals. I don't really have another avenue for live visuals other than possibly using Max to live patch using Jitter. Max is great, and I've spent a great amount of time on it and Pure Data, but recently I haven't really been enjoying visual scripting languages. I'm too clumsy with the mouse to do it faster than I can type or patch a physical cable, so Hydra is almost perfect for what I desire.
